Custom Pagination

## After Cloning

You can use the custom pagination component anywhere you need it.
This Component requires only three pros to control it.

When you use it you have to pass

1. total number of pages as `totalPage`

2. value of the current page as `currentPage` and

3. `setCurrentPage` function to move from one page to another.

## Design Customization

You can easily customize the style of the pagination using css. Just take the parent class `cp-pagination` and style as you needed.
